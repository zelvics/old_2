## About
This was another one of my personal sites that used to be available at [zelvics.com](https://zelvics.com) (no longer working on it).

## Disclaimer
This is now archived, there will be no improvements or fixes of this.

## Click to enter
HTML has a funny thing where you have to 'interact' with a website before you can play audio, so we take care of that by adding the '[ENTER]' that is visible. This causes the interaction modern web browsers need to start playing audio.

## Install
Download as ZIP in top right (code dropdown)
